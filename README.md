# Laska
Lasca implemented in 3D in Unity. It is a draughts (or checkers) variant, invented by the second World Chess Champion Emanuel Lasker.

A characteristic feature of this variant is that the pieces, instead of being eliminated from the game, are taken prisoner - the taken piece is placed under the taking one, forming a column.
The column is ruled by the piece on its top. When an opponent jumps over a column, only its ruler is captured, thus releasing the next piece in the column.
The starting pieces are called Soldiers (in my version "Żymianie") and are promoted to the Officers (in my version "Zbycholudy") on the last rank.
Soldiers can only move and take forwards, Officers can also do it backwards (one square, no flying). The board is 7x7 with light squares in the corners.
Initially, the Soldiers of each player are on the opposite sides of the board, placed on the light squares in the first 3 lines.
Capture is mandatory, but if more than one path is available then it is a free choice. Promotion ends a multi-take.
The object of the game is to prevent your opponent from moving. A stalemate or taking all of your opponent's pieces captive wins.
D4 is cheese just for a meme. 
My version of the game is "Żymskie"-themed which means that it contains references to the universe built around the Polish chess streamer twitch.tv/xntentacion and his community.
